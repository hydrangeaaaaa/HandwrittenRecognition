# HandwrittenRecognition
This is a two layer neural network to recognize the handwritten digits. 

The main method is used to train the weights and you can also initialise your own weight and use this main method to train
the neural network.

The training and testing set are the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
